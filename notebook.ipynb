Loading the NIPS papers\n<p>The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These NIPS papers are stored in <code>datasets/papers.csv</code>. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/project_158/img/nips_logo.png\" alt=\"The logo of NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)\"></p>\n<p>First, we will explore the CSV file to determine what type of data we can use for the analysis and how it is structured. A research paper typically consists of a title, an abstract and the main text. Other data such as figures and tables were not extracted from the PDF files. Each paper discusses a novel technique or improvement. In this analysis, we will focus on analyzing these papers with natural language processing methods.</p>","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"tags":["sample_code"],"dc":{"key":"4"},"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"FileNotFoundError","traceback":["---------------------------------------------------------------------------","FileNotFoundError                         Traceback (most recent call last)","<ipython-input-24-5c24b0e4a822> in <module>()\n      4 \n      5 # Read datasets/papers.csv into papers\n----> 6 papers = pd.read_csv('datasets/papers.csv.csv')\n      7 \n      8 # Print out the first rows of papers\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pandas/io/parsers.py in parser_f(filepath_or_buffer, sep, delimiter, header, names, index_col, usecols, squeeze, prefix, mangle_dupe_cols, dtype, engine, converters, true_values, false_values, skipinitialspace, skiprows, nrows, na_values, keep_default_na, na_filter, verbose, skip_blank_lines, parse_dates, infer_datetime_format, keep_date_col, date_parser, dayfirst, iterator, chunksize, compression, thousands, decimal, lineterminator, quotechar, quoting, escapechar, comment, encoding, dialect, tupleize_cols, error_bad_lines, warn_bad_lines, skipfooter, skip_footer, doublequote, delim_whitespace, as_recarray, compact_ints, use_unsigned, low_memory, buffer_lines, memory_map, float_precision)\n    707                     skip_blank_lines=skip_blank_lines)\n    708 \n--> 709         return _read(filepath_or_buffer, kwds)\n    710 \n    711     parser_f.__name__ = name\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pandas/io/parsers.py in _read(filepath_or_buffer, kwds)\n    447 \n    448     # Create the parser.\n--> 449     parser = TextFileReader(filepath_or_buffer, **kwds)\n    450 \n    451     if chunksize or iterator:\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pandas/io/parsers.py in __init__(self, f, engine, **kwds)\n    816             self.options['has_index_names'] = kwds['has_index_names']\n    817 \n--> 818         self._make_engine(self.engine)\n    819 \n    820     def close(self):\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pandas/io/parsers.py in _make_engine(self, engine)\n   1047     def _make_engine(self, engine='c'):\n   1048         if engine == 'c':\n-> 1049             self._engine = CParserWrapper(self.f, **self.options)\n   1050         else:\n   1051             if engine == 'python':\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pandas/io/parsers.py in __init__(self, src, **kwds)\n   1693         kwds['allow_leading_cols'] = self.index_col is not False\n   1694 \n-> 1695         self._reader = parsers.TextReader(src, **kwds)\n   1696 \n   1697         # XXX\n","pandas/_libs/parsers.pyx in pandas._libs.parsers.TextReader.__cinit__()\n","pandas/_libs/parsers.pyx in pandas._libs.parsers.TextReader._setup_parser_source()\n","FileNotFoundError: File b'datasets/papers.csv.csv' does not exist"],"evalue":"File b'datasets/papers.csv.csv' does not exist"}],"execution_count":24,"source":"# Importing modules\n# -- YOUR CODE HERE --\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read datasets/papers.csv into papers\npapers = pd.read_csv('datasets/papers.csv.csv')\n\n# Print out the first rows of papers\n# -- YOUR CODE HERE --\npapers.head()","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"run_control":{"frozen":true},"editable":false,"tags":["context"],"dc":{"key":"11"},"deletable":false},"source":"## 2.

Prepare the text for LDA analysis\n<p>The main text analysis method that we will use is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LDA is able to perform topic detection on large document sets, determining what the main 'topics' are in a large unlabeled set of texts.

First, it is necessary to convert the documents into a simple vector representation. This representation will then be used by LDA to determine the topics.

In conclusion, we will convert a list of titles into a list of vectors, all with length equal to the vocabulary.
